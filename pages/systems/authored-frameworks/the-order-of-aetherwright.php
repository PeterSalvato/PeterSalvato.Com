  <h1>The Order of the Ætherwright</h1>
  <p>A symbolic system for bringing clarity to complex, long-form work.  
  The Order helps structure intent, track progress, and make invisible dynamics visible.</p>
  
  <p class="tagline">A practical framework for reflective systems design and semantic clarity.</p>

      <h2>What is the Order of the Ætherwright?</h2>
      <p>
        The Order is a symbolic toolkit for making sense of complex work.  
        It uses glyphs, domains, and structured iconography to help you map intent, trace progress,
        and clarify the underlying structure of your projects.
        It’s part taxonomy, part visual language, part thinking framework.

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Creative systems tend to get messy.  
        Meaning gets abstracted, intentions get lost.  
        The Order brings structure to that entropy — giving you a way to reflect, track, and refine your work with symbolic precision.

    <section class="how-it-works">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Glyph System:</strong> Visual symbols representing cognitive and creative domains like research, refinement, and publication.</li>
        <li><strong>Symbolic Sessions:</strong> Projects are annotated with glyphs to track intent and progress over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Semantic Codex:</strong> A shared vocabulary of terms and icons used across Savepoints, journals, and systems.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="who-its-for">
      <h2>Who It's For</h2>
      <p>
        Builders, designers, developers, writers, researchers —  
        anyone who needs a flexible system for bringing clarity to their own work  
        without adopting a rigid, one-size-fits-all framework.
