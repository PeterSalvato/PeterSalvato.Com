  <p>This site was hand-authored using PHP, semantic HTML, and a minimalist CSS scaffold. No CMS, no framework, no JavaScript dependencies.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fonts: IBM Plex Mono, system UI stack</li>
    <li>Stack: PHP + flat files + GitHub Codespaces</li>
    <li>Graphics: Designed in Figma + Affinity Designer</li>
    <li>Deployment: Manual or static host preview</li>

        <li>PHP (modular, flat-file architecture)</li>
        <li>SCSS → compiled to CSS for layout and typography</li>
        <li>JavaScript + jQuery (minimal DOM interaction and enhancements)</li>

    <!-- Authoring Approach -->
    <section class="authoring-approach">
      <h2>Authoring Philosophy</h2>
      <p>This site is authored and versioned by hand using semantic markup and recursive systems. Each page is treated as a cognitive unit, with structured metadata and validated content paths. No CMS. No bloat. Just authored infrastructure designed for clarity and longevity.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Tools Used -->
    <section class="tools-used">
      <h2>Design & Development Tools</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio Code + WSL2 (Ubuntu)</li>
        <li>Figma (design mockups and interface layout)</li>
        <li>Obsidian (writing environment + Savepoint output)</li>
        <li>Git + GitHub (versioning and collaboration)</li>

  <h1>Colophon</h1>
  <p>This site was designed as a semantic-first system, reflecting my approach to cognitive durability and scalable clarity in complex environments. Every page structure, pattern, and typographic choice serves to reinforce legibility, traceability, and meaning preservation.</p>
  <p>The infrastructure is hand-built using PHP and modular templates. Content is authored in Obsidian markdown vaults and rendered with a focus on semantic HTML and minimal reliance on heavy frameworks. This reflects the same principles I advocate in systems design — reducing cognitive friction, preserving authorship lineage, and embedding meaning into the structure itself.</p>
  <p>Typography is inspired by the aesthetics of functional print systems, using typefaces aligned with technical and archival legibility. Custom assets are designed to echo themes of information durability and epistemic clarity.</p>
  <p>Colophon structure adapted and authored by Peter Salvato. All systems authored. All pathways deliberate.</p>
