  <h1>Practice — Systems Thinking in Action</h1>

  <p>While my authored systems — like <a href="/systems/savepoint-protocol.php">Savepoint Protocol</a> and <a href="/systems/php-site-validator.php">Validator Framework</a> — demonstrate how I think, this page shows how those same principles apply across different real-world contexts.</p>

  <p>Every team, platform, or brand I work with faces the same core challenges: <strong>semantic drift, cognitive overload, and scaling without losing clarity.</strong> My role is to design durable systems that preserve meaning and reduce friction as complexity increases.</p>

    <h2>Product Teams & Platforms</h2>
    <p>When scaling platforms, design systems sprawl and misalignment between design, development, and product teams becomes inevitable. I design frameworks that embed semantic clarity into design systems and frontend infrastructure — ensuring teams stay aligned and velocity increases, not decreases, as scale grows.</p>

    <h2>Founder-Led Brands</h2>
    <p>Brands often start with clear vision but grow organically, leading to fragmented systems and inconsistent execution. I treat brand systems as operational infrastructure — embedding strategic clarity into scalable structures that support growth while preserving founder intent.</p>

    <h2>Creative & Design Ops</h2>
    <p>Creative teams resist rigid systems for good reason — but lack of structure leads to chaos, rework, and lost nuance. I build frameworks that support operational clarity without stifling creativity, enabling design ops to scale sustainably.</p>
