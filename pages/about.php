  <section class="about-role">
    <h2>Cognitive Semantic Architect</h2>
    <p>
      This isn’t an industry title — it’s the best name I’ve found for the work I do.
      Designing systems that preserve meaning, reduce cognitive friction, and scale with integrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work sits at the intersection of UX architecture, systems design, and platform governance.
      I build frameworks that help teams, platforms, and brands stay aligned as they grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systems like <a href="/savepoint">Savepoint Protocol</a>, <a href="/validator">Validator Framework</a>,
      and the <a href="/order">Order of the Ætherwright</a> are how I formalize that work.

    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a systems designer, platform architect, and semantic interface engineer.
      For over 12 years, I’ve worked across UX, front-end engineering, and internal platform development.
      My specialty is making complex systems understandable and durable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I create tools and frameworks that keep decisions traceable, interfaces resilient, and systems aligned as they grow.
      Design and engineering are fused in my work — every system I build is shaped for longevity, clarity, and context.
    </p>

  <section class="about-platform">
    <h2>Platform Work — Cluen Corporation</h2>
    <p>
      At Cluen Corporation, I lead front-end architecture and interface design for an enterprise platform used by global clients,
      including Fortune 50 and Fortune 100 firms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I maintain our internal JavaScript component system, manage SCSS architecture, and design semantic token systems
      that align structure, style, and accessibility.
      I integrate third-party libraries while preserving internal logic and consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      My role spans product vision and engineering execution — ensuring platform systems scale without losing clarity.
    </p>

  <section class="about-focus">
    <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Systems that express intention through structure</li>
      <li>Tools that embed decision logic into components and flows</li>
      <li>Semantic architecture that scales with clarity</li>
      <li>Frameworks for recursive thinking and authorship traceability</li>
      <li>Durable design infrastructure for high-context, long-term work</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="about-closing">
    <p>
      The systems I’ve authored — Savepoint.Protocol, Validator Framework, and others — are not products.
      They’re architectural responses to common failure points in complex platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I build for teams that need their systems to last.
      Where structure has to carry more than state — it has to carry meaning.
