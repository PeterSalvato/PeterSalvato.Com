  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    I’m a systems designer, platform architect, and semantic interface engineer. My focus is simple:
    build infrastructure that carries meaning—across time, scale, and context.

    Over the past 12+ years, I’ve worked across UI/UX architecture, front-end engineering, and internal platform development. I create tools and frameworks that make decisions traceable, interfaces resilient, and complexity navigable.

    I don’t separate design from engineering—they’re a fused skillset. That fusion lets me model systems holistically: anticipating future states, shaping authorial structure, and building environments where clarity survives drift.

    Much of my authored work—recursive, semantic, and durable—is a response to what traditional systems often lack: continuity of thought.
    I’ve seen what happens when intent gets lost in execution, or when structure doesn’t preserve reasoning. So I built tools that do the opposite.
    Platform Work (Cluen Corporation)

    In parallel to my authored systems work, I lead front-end architecture and interface design at Cluen Corporation—an enterprise platform used globally, including by clients in the Fortune 50 and Fortune 100.

    I designed and maintain the internal JavaScript namespace and component system that structures our browser-based UI. This includes reusable modules for alerts, confirmations, and media viewers—built for consistency, semantic clarity, and maintainability.

    My role spans product vision and engineering execution. I translate exploratory interface ideas from senior stakeholders into implementable systems—ensuring new functionality integrates without fracturing existing structure or accessibility standards.

    I maintain full platform accessibility: embedding ARIA roles, semantic markup, and structurally informative tokens that make the interface readable to both users and developers. I also oversee the SCSS architecture and authored a custom token system that aligns layout logic, visual style, and brand semantics.

    In addition to this authored layer, I integrate external libraries—such as the Kendo UI component toolkit for data visualization—into our architecture. These third-party tools are adapted to preserve internal logic, accessibility, and visual continuity. The constraint becomes part of the system—not an exception to it.

    This work ensures that the platform remains durable, legible, and extensible—both for current teams and future maintainers.
    Focus Areas
      
        Interface systems that express intention through structure

        Tooling that embeds decision logic into components and flows

        Semantic architecture for platforms that can’t afford drift

        Systems that support recursive thinking and traceable authorship

        Durable design infrastructure for high-context, long-term work

    My current authored tools—Savepoint.Protocol, Validator Framework, and semantic publishing layers—aren’t products. They’re architectural responses.
    Designed to hold clarity where conventional tooling loses it.

    I build for teams that need their systems to last.
    For environments where structure has to carry more than state—it has to carry meaning.
