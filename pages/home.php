    <h1>Designing Systems That Think With You</h1>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a front-end architect and cognitive systems designer with 12+ years building interface infrastructure for enterprise platforms. My work combines semantic engineering, interface logic, and recursive authorship protocols to preserve meaning across time, teams, and tools.

    <p>
      This site serves as both a professional profile and a public demonstration of the authored systems
      I use in my own thinking.
