    <h1>Designing Systems That Think</h1>
    <p>
      Scaling platforms tends to erase clarity.  
      Decisions get disconnected from their reasons.  
      Interfaces drift from their intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I build frameworks that stop that from happening.  
      Tools that help teams keep meaning intact â€” even as systems grow more complex.

      <p>
        A system for keeping authorship lineage visible.  
        Helps teams track why decisions were made, and prevent context loss as work evolves.

      <p>
        A governance layer that keeps design systems honest.  
        Maintains pattern consistency and semantic integrity as platforms scale.
