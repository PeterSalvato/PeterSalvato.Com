# ✅ **How to Use This in Obsidian**

- This can live as a single **“petersalvato.com Taskboard.md”** note.
    
- You can embed Kanban plugins later, but even in plain Markdown this gives you visual clarity.
    
- You can backlink tasks to content notes.
    
- The RGB pathway colors keep your mental map intact across sections.

Would you like me to also give you a **visual Obsidian graph view structure** (how these notes interlink semantically) for this project?  
Reply: **“Yes, give me the graph structure.”**  
It’ll be like a mental map of how everything ties together in Obsidian.
