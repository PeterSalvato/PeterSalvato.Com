Peter Salvato is a designer, engineer, and accidental urban homesteader, navigating the space where code, ink, and gluten-free flour meet. Raised in Brooklyn, he’s more interested in what works than in following trends—whether that’s crafting a custom typeface or growing bananas and jalapeños in his backyard. His approach to design is like his approach to everything else: hands-on, no-nonsense, and always curious.

A graduate of the School of Visual Arts, Peter’s work spans a variety of mediums, mixing the precision of technology with the soul of craft. Think *Bauhaus at a dive bar*—bold, beautiful, and functional design with just the right amount of grit. Moving fluidly between disciplines, he has a knack for seeing the hidden connections that others might overlook. Whether he’s building a brand or fine-tuning a web app, his aim is always the same: to create work that’s functional, beautiful, and built to last.

When he’s not elbow-deep in Photoshop or pulling a screenprint, Peter’s likely baking gluten-free bread that defies expectations or coaxing life out of his backyard garden, where bananas and jalapeños thrive. He’s always experimenting across mediums, blending ideas, and pushing boundaries to find the unexpected.

For Peter, design isn’t just a profession—it’s a way of thinking, a way of exploring how things work. Whether he’s tinkering with code, crafting a new brand, or growing the perfect tomato, he’s constantly learning and connecting ideas in unexpected ways.

You aim for self-reliance and resilience, focusing on creating a legacy for the future.
    
- **Quiet Leadership and Mentorship**: You don’t seem interested in the traditional spotlight, but you lead through action, mentorship, and system-building.

This reflects your desire to create environments where people can thrive, and it also demonstrates a deep level of care and involvement.
    
- **Holistic Thinker with Practical Execution**: You balance big-picture thinking with the ability to dive into details and get things done.

- **Confident Without Pretense**: Your approach is one of genuine expertise paired with humility. You focus on the quality of work rather than seeking external validation or self-promotion.

- **Innovative Yet Grounded**: You like to challenge the status quo and push boundaries but do so with a sense of grounding. Whether it’s building something cutting-edge like a cyberdeck or exploring ways to gamify family chores, your projects are filled with creative ambition but remain practical and thoughtful, designed with real-world application in mind.
