Hiraeth
## 1. _Hygge_

### **Language:** [**Danish**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/danish)

## 2. _Dépaysement_

### **Language:** [**French**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/french)

A feeling of disorientation that comes from traveling in a country (or countries) that is not your home. The feeling can be good—inspiring positive new perspectives on oneself and the world—or not so good—triggering slight homesickness. It depends on the way the term is used.

## 3. _Koi No Yokan_

### **Language:** [**Japanese**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/japanese)

Ever met someone and had the very memorable feeling that you knew you’d fall in love with them? Not exactly being in love and not exactly love at first sight, Koi No Yokan is something in between.

The Japanese conveys a sense of the inevitable—there’s nothing you can do to stop it; it’s going to happen whether you want it to or not!

## 4. 加油

### **Language: Chinese**

An expression of encouragement or support, this word translates to “Add oil!” which means you are backing someone up and showing you’re on the same team.

At a sporting event or before a school exam, you might hear someone say, “You’ll do fine. Add oil!” The person who says it means to wish someone good luck but also show they are offering support.

## 5. _Torschlusspanik_

### **Language:** [**German**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/german)

Literally translated as “door closing panic,” this phrase refers to the feeling that one’s window of opportunity is closing as one gets older.

That window could be for having a successful career, finding a partner, having a baby, or accomplishing something one wants to do before it’s too late.

## 6. _Commuovere_

### **Language:** [**Italian**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/italian)

This word means you’ve been moved or touched, or had your heart warmed, by someone. Specifically, it’s a story that has stirred your heart or moved you to tears.

It could be a story you hear from a friend, watch in a film, or read in a book. The emphasis on the story is what makes this term unique.


## 7. _Inshallah_

### **Language:** [**Arabic**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/arabic)

Similar to “God willing,” this word translates to “if God wills it.” You might think of this as more of an expression than a feeling, but it conveys a feeling of being uncertain while hoping for the best.

You might say it to a friend this way: “I’ll be going home for the holidays—Inshallah” with two fingers crossed for good luck.

## **8.** 분위기

### **Language:** [**Korean**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/korean)

**Pronunciation:** _boon-wee-gi_

This is the atmosphere or mood of a situation. You could also translate it to “ambiance.” By combining it with different terms, you might say something like **갑분띠**: **갑**자기 **분**위기 **띠**용 or **갑분싸**: **갑**자기 **분**위기 **싸**해졌다 which both mean the atmosphere is suddenly ruined (turned cold).

## 9. _Mágoa_

A heart-breaking feeling—usually by being hurt by someone—that leaves long-lasting traces, visible in gestures and facial expressions.

## 10. _Lebensmüde_

### **Language: [German](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/german)**

This word translates to “life tiredness” and means basically what it sounds like. It’s the feeling of being tired or weary of life. It could be used when one is depressed, but also to justify some adventurous, out-of-character behavior that one wouldn’t otherwise partake in: blame the life-tiredness!

## 11. _Meraki_

### **Language:** [**Greek**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/greek)

Meraki means doing something with passion, devotion, and creativity—in other words, putting your soul or self into something. It may be an artistic task, but it doesn’t have to be. The word is related to the Turkish “Merak,” or labor of love.

## 12. _Forelsket_

### **Language:** [**Norwegian**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/norwegian)

Forelsket is being in love, but specifically the ecstatic, all-consuming feeling at the beginning of a relationship when you can barely think of anything else. Thank the Norwegians for recognizing the nuance here, since this isn’t a feeling that lasts forever!

## 13. _Jijivisha_

### **Language:** [**Hindi**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/hindi)

This one’s especially hard to translate though we all know someone who fits the description. Used as a noun, **_jijivisha_** is the intense desire to live (or continue living) in the highest sense of being.

You might hear a Hindi speaker using it to describe someone who lives their life to the fullest.

## 14. _Eudaimonia_

### **Language:** [**Greek**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/greek)

A state of well-being. It means to be content, to flourish, to be grateful, and live well.

## 15. _Ailyak_

### **Language:** [**Bulgarian**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/bulgarian)

## 16. _Weltschmertz_

### **Language: [German](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/german)**

Literally translated as “world-weariness” or “world pain,” this term is now used to describe the melancholic feeling of being overwhelmed at the state of the world while being a part of it.

“**_Weltschmerz_** is the sense both that one is personally inadequate and that one’s personal inadequacy reflects the inadequacy of the world generally,” says Joachim Whaley, a professor of German history and thought at the University of Cambridge.

## 17. _Sielvartas_

## 21. _Waldeinsamkeit_

## 22. _Onsra_

Maybe your love just isn’t meant to be forever or it’s time to move on. In that case, **_onsra_** is your emotion. Boro is a Sino-Tibetan language spoken in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.

## 23. _Sisu_

## 25. _Toska_

### **Language:** [**Russian**](https://www.berlitz.com/languages/russian)

Leave it to the Russians to create some of the most profound emotion words. **_Toska_** means great spiritual anguish without a particular cause, and the writer Vladimir Nabokov made sure to emphasize that no English word could capture its subtleties.

“In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness,” he wrote. “At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom.”



**_Awumbuk_**_:_ There is an emptiness after visitors depart. The walls echo. The space which felt so cramped while they were here now seems weirdly large. Sometimes everything seems a bit pointless. The indigenous Baining people who live in the mountains of Papua New Guinea are so familiar with this experience that they name it _awumbuk_. They believe departing visitors shed a kind of heaviness when they leave, so as to travel lightly. This oppressive mist hovers for three days, leaving everyone feeling distracted and apathetic. To counter it, the Baining fill a bowl with water and leave it overnight to absorb the festering air. The next day, the family rises very early and ceremonially flings the water into the trees, whereupon ordinary life resumes.

**_L’appel du vide_**_:_ Walking along a high cliff path, you are gripped by a terrifying urge to leap. As an express train hurtles into view, you itch to fling yourself in front of it. People talk of a fear of heights, but in truth anxieties about precipices are often less to do with falling than with the horrifying compulsion to jump. The French have a name for this unnerving impulse: _l’appel du vide_, “the call of the void.” As Jean-Paul Sartre recognized, _l’appel du vide_ creates the shaky sensation that even our own instincts are not always to be trusted.

**_Dolce far niente_**_:_ The pleasure of doing nothing.

_**Formal feeling, a**:_ Sometimes life’s most painful experiences can leave us feeling eerily cold and a little mechanical. Emily Dickinson described it as “a formal feeling.” The heart seems stiff and detached, our emotions wary and ceremonious. “This is the Hour of Lead,” wrote Dickinson. “First–Chill–then Stupor–then the letting go–.”

**_Greng Jai_**_:_ In Thailand, _greng jai_ (pronounced: _kreng_ jai) is the feeling of being reluctant to accept another’s offer of help because of the bother it would call them.

**_Hiraeth_**_:_ The Welsh word _hiraeth_ (pronounced _hir_-aeth, with a rolled ‘r’) describes a deeply felt connection with one’s homeland, casting its woods and hills in an almost magical glow. But _hiraeth_ is not a feeling of coziness or comfort. It is rather a yearning feeling, flecked with suspense, as if something is about to be lost and never recovered. Perhaps it is Wales’ long history of English occupation which has given rise to this combination of a love for home and a sense of its vulnerability. Today, _hiraeth_ is most commonly associated with émigrés, experienced most sharply on returning home—and knowing the time to leave again will come all too soon.

**_Homefulness_**_:_ In July 1841, the poet John Clare escaped from High Beech asylum in Epping Forest to get home to his beloved Mary Joyce. For three and a half days he walked with broken shoes, sleeping in porches and eating grass from the roadside. He recalled that, exhausted and foot-foundered, he reached the point where the road forks to Peterborough and was suddenly restored: “I felt myself in home’s way.” The writer Iain Sinclair, who retraced Clare’s journey, used the little-known word “homefulness” to describe Clare’s feeling at this point. He became full with the feeling of home.

**_Iktsuarpok_**_:_ When visitors are due to arrive, a fidgety feeling sprouts up. We might keep glancing out of the window, or pause mid-sentence, thinking we’ve heard the sound of a car. Among the Inuit, this antsy anticipation, causing them to scan the frozen Arctic tundra for approaching sledges, is called iktsuarpok (pronounced: _eet-_so-_ahr_-pohk).

**_Liget_**_:_ It’s the fire in the chili and the rush in the rapids. It makes tempers fly and drives people to work harder. Among the Ilongot, a tribe of around 3,500 headhunters living in the gloomy jungles of Nueva Vizcaya in the Philippines, _Liget_ is the name given to an angry energy which fuels human and non-humans alike. Anger is sometimes seen as a negative emotion, but for Ilongot, _Liget_ speaks above all of optimism and vitality. It is certainly capable of stirring up pointless arguments and violent outbursts. But it also excites and motivates, making people plant more seeds than their neighbors, or stay out hunting for longer. “If it were not for _Liget_,” one Ilongot told the anthropologist Michelle Rosaldo, “we’d have no life, we’d never work.”

**_Matutolypea_**_:_ The alarm clock trills. The dawn slips in through the curtains. And we awake, overcome with misery and bad temper. Your grandmother might know it as “getting out of bed on the wrong side.” But it is, in fact, the much more important-sounding matutolypea (pronounced: mah-tu-toh-leh-_pee_-a). No one quite knows when the word was invented or by whom, but it comes from a combination of the name of the Roman goddess of the dawn, Mater Matuta, and the Greek word for dejection, lype, to give us the dignity of “morning sorrow.”

**_Mono no aware_**_:_ Murasaki Shikibu, a poet and lady-in-waiting in 12th-century Japan, crafted what is often described today as the world’s first novel, _The Tale of Genji_. Set in the imperial court, it recounts the political intrigues and love affairs of an emperor’s illegitimate son. The book is infused with a quiet feeling for life’s transience, a sensitivity to the beauty of decay and the fading of all living and inanimate things. To read it is to become well acquainted with the feeling the Japanese call _mono no aware_ (pronounced: moh-_noh_ noh ah-_wah_-ray). Literally translated as the pathos (_aware_) of things (_mono_), it is often described as a kind of a sigh for the impermanence of life.

_**Mudita**:_ For Gautama Buddha who lived in the fifth or sixth century BCE, joy was not a scarce resource to be competed over. He saw it as boundless, and contagious, and used the word mudita (pronounced moo-_dee_-ta) to capture an experience of joy felt on hearing of someone else’s good fortune.

_**Nakhes**:_ Perhaps your youngest has just crawled for the first time, or your oldest has cooked a quiche. Seeing a child achieve something—anything!—can make the heart feel like it’s about to burst with joy. In Yiddish there’s a special word for this feeling: _nakhes_ (pronounced: _na_-khez, with the _kh_ pronounced like the _ch_ in loch). It makes parents _kvell_ (crow with delight) over even the littlest achievements of their squirming offspring, binding the generations together in a shared feeling of success.

_**Pronoia**:_ A strange, creeping feeling that everyone’s out to help you.

_**Ruinenlust**:_ Feeling irresistibly drawn to crumbling buildings and abandoned places.

_**Toska**:_ So much of our emotional life is linked to the landscape. The craggy wilderness of the mountains gave the Romantics their love of loneliness and terror. In Russia, the emotion _toska_ (pronounced: _tas_-ka) is said to bellow in from Europe’s Great Plains, which sweep from the Pyrenees to the Ural mountains, and bring a maddening feeling of “unsatisfiedness,” an insatiable searching. For Vladimir Nabokov, _toska_ was a distinctly Russian emotion, “a dull ache” of the soul, “a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness.”

**_Umpty_**_:_ Perkin Flump is in a very bad mood. (The Flumps was a 1970s children’s cartoon presenting the home life of a family of round furry creatures who lived in northern England.) The water is too cold. The floor is too bumpy. His porridge is too lumpy and too sticky. “I feel umpty” he tells his mother. “What’s umpty?” she asks. “It’s a too-much morning” he explains and stomps off to be on his own. Umpty: a feeling of everything being “too much” and all in the wrong way.
