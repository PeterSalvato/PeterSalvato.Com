### Format

1. **Website Focus:**
   - the website will be designed to serve primarily as an educational resource with detailed articles, and it also may include interactive elements like timelines and interactive infographics. 

2. **Supplemental Printed Materials:**
   - the project will feature high-quality posters featuring designers, typographers, and design schools/movements and also include smaller, collectible items like trading cards?
   - These supplemental materials will be standalone products and as part of a larger compiled work such as a deck of cards and/or book. 

3. **Ongoing Project:**
   - the initial thought is to release one entry per week for a year.
   - entries will be random throughout the history of design to maintain interest. 

### Content Structure

**Educational Content:**
   - The educational content should be divided into major historical periods or movements (e.g., Bauhaus, Swiss Style, Digital Age) but each entry be presented in random order for posts and chronological for timelines and books etc.
   - each entry should include very basic profiles of individual designers and more detailed overviews of their contributions and styles.

**Sellable/Collectible Content:**
   - each entry will be designed into a series that can be posters or some type of trading card. each should include not only images but also short bios and key contributions of each designer 
   - there will be a shop where collectable content can be purchased including but not limited to: 
     - trading cards
     - posters
     - buttons
     - magnets
     - stickers


### Design Style

**International Typographic Style:**
   - The International Typographic Style will be the overall design of the project.
   - There should be a minimalist approach with clean lines and sans-serif fonts mixed with interesting and relevant typography for headlines. There should be a decidedly analog look to the work as well incorporating texturing, grit/grain, vintage looking colors, halftones, and an intentional "out of registration" look.
