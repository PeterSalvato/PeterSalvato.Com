Version-Control for the Self (Fragments, not Drafts)

Writers forget more than they remember.
Designers overwrite their best ideas.
Developers push new branches, then delete the ones that mattered.

Meanwhile, our tools pretend we’re working linearly: brainstorm → refine → publish. But that’s not how thinking works. It loops. It fragments. It recurs.

This essay proposes a mindset shift: treat every thought like a commit. Savepoint isn’t just a protocol for authorship—it’s version control for your inner life.
The Problem with Drafts

Drafts are lies.

They imply hierarchy: This is the real one.
They imply linearity: This came after that.
They imply authorship status: This is ready.

But what about:

    The idea you captured in a voice memo at 2am?

    The half-paragraph you deleted because it felt “off”?

    The design note that made sense until you lost the context?

Those are the real signals. They’re just not visible.
Git for Brains

Version control in code is table stakes.
You wouldn’t ship software without tracking changes.
Why would you write, think, or create without it?

Savepoint introduces a simple structure for personal commits:

<savepoint>
  <author>you</author>
  <context>reflection</context>
  <tags>identity, drift</tags>
  <body>I think I’m orbiting the same idea I wrote down in March...</body>
  <timestamp>2025‑05‑21</timestamp>
</savepoint>

No judgment. No hierarchy. Just a trace.
Fragments over Drafts

Instead of one perfect draft, you now have hundreds of fragments—each traceable, tagged, and retrievable.

    Want to find everything you wrote about “loneliness”? Run a grep on Savepoint tags.

    Want to compare how you described an idea 8 months ago vs now? Diff the entries.

    Want to find the exact sentence that led to a product name? It’s there, fingerprinted.

You Already Have the Data

This isn’t about journaling more.

You already have:

    Notes app chaos

    Chat logs with yourself

    Drafts folder graveyards

    Google Docs you forgot existed

Savepoint gives you a schema and a CLI to index it all.
Then resurface it by tag, keyword, date, or context.

Pattern Resurfacing

The magic happens in reflection.

Once you’ve captured 30, 50, 100 fragments—you start to see patterns:

    A theme you thought was new... isn’t.

    A phrase you keep using... is a clue.

    A tension that keeps returning... is a thread to pull.

Savepoint doesn’t solve these for you.
It shows you where to go digging.

Real Life Use

I’ve used this system to:

    Recover a song lyric I thought I’d lost

    Finish an essay that started 9 months earlier

    Find the moment I pivoted a product’s naming strategy

    Notice how many times I almost built the same idea without realizing

That’s not productivity.

That’s cognitive continuity.
Start in Under 5 Minutes

mkdir -p savepoints/{journal,conversations,research}
echo "<savepoint>your first fragment here</savepoint>" > savepoints/journal/2025-05-21.xml

No sync.
No database.
No front end.

Just durable thinking, structured enough to survive its moment, light enough to not get in your way.
Fragments Tell the Truth

We were never meant to work in clean drafts.

We think in loops. We remember in pieces.
We design in fragments.

But with the right system—fragments become history.
And history becomes a map you can actually use.
