Semantics, Ontology & Epistemology in Design Systems

    Structure isn’t something you add to design. It’s what design is.

In a world of ever‑faster interfaces, component libraries, and no‑code everything, it’s easy to forget that the most enduring systems are the ones that mean something. Not to the compiler. To the team. To the people who inherit your work next quarter. To the future you who won’t remember why that variable is named intent instead of trigger.

This essay makes the case that semantics, ontology, and epistemology aren’t abstract theory—they’re design infrastructure. And that every system, no matter how small, already contains them by accident. The question is whether you’re ready to use them on purpose.
Semantics ≠ Naming

Most people think “semantics” means “what we call things.” But real semantics is what things mean in context—and whether that meaning is shared.

    A button labeled “Submit” in a job app flow has a different semantic load than in a mortgage approval portal.

    “Draft” might mean “writable but not live” to you—but “approved for internal preview” to someone else.

Design fails not when visuals clash—but when shared meaning collapses.
Ontology is Contract

If semantics is meaning, ontology is the set of allowable meanings. It’s the formal grammar of what types of objects, actions, and states exist in your system—and how they relate.

Without ontology, everything becomes a label war. How many times has your team:

    Debated “is this a feature or a module?”

    Argued about “what counts as done” across PM and design?

    Tried to onboard someone who couldn’t tell status=reviewed from status=approved?

What you’re seeing is ontology drift—the same term mapped to different concepts, depending on who’s looking.
Epistemology is Trust

Epistemology is the most intimidating word here. But it’s also the most critical. It’s not about knowledge itself—it’s about how we know what we know.

Every team functions on trust: that a label means what it says, that a commit reflects a real change, that a component behaves as expected. When teams drift, it’s often not because of process gaps, but because they’ve lost confidence in the truth structure behind the work.

Ontological clarity rebuilds that trust.
From Philosophy to Linter

These aren’t just nice ideas. Here’s how we bake them into a system.

Enter the Validator.

Every page on my site contains a metadata block like:

$page_meta = [
  "title" => "Anti-Entropy Workflows",
  "type" => "essay",
  "domain" => "systems",
  "stage" => "published"
];

The Validator runs in meta‑extraction mode. It checks:

    Is every required key present?

    Does the value belong to the agreed ontology?

    Is this entry in semantic alignment with its type?

Impact in the Real World

We ran the Validator across 1,200 flat files in a project archive. Just by enforcing semantic completeness and ontology conformance, we:

    Cut unknown status flags from 63 → 0

    Reduced page rendering errors by 35%

    Brought internal naming disputes to the surface before they became merge conflicts

Build Your Own Ontology (Lightweight)

Don’t overthink it. Start with three columns:
Term	Type	Accepted Values
stage	system	draft · reviewed · live
domain	tag	design · research · ops
confidence	float 0–1	0.4, 0.7, 0.9

Stick this in your README. Then validate it before rendering or publishing anything.

You don’t need RDF or OWL or JSON-LD. You need semantic discipline.
This Is Design Work

Too many teams silo “naming” as a UX concern. Or treat metadata as dev-only. Or ignore how ideas gain or lose trust over time.

But if you’re building systems—product systems, design systems, content systems—then you’re already working with semantics, ontology, and epistemology.

You might as well learn their names.
