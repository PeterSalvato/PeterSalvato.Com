## Headline:

> **Designing Systems That Hold Up**

I’m Peter Salvato.  
I help teams, platforms, and creative operations stay structurally sound as they grow and evolve.

## My Approach:

Good design isn’t just visual —  
it’s **structural, semantic, and durable**.

I focus on:
- Preserving the **why** behind decisions.
- Embedding semantic clarity into the systems themselves.
- Reducing cognitive friction across design, development, and product teams.

My work is about making complex systems **legible, maintainable, and scalable**.

## Background:

- Studied **design & typography** at School of Visual Arts.
- 12+ years leading **frontend architecture & UX systems** at enterprise scale.
- Built internal frameworks to manage complexity, reduce friction, and scale team velocity.
- Creator of **Savepoint Protocol**, **Validator Framework**, and **Order of Aetherwright** —  
    all designed to solve real-world semantic degradation in teams & systems.
