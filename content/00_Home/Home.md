# Peter Salvato — Systems Architecture & UX Clarity

## Headline:

> **I design durable systems that preserve meaning and reduce cognitive load at scale.**

## Subhead:

> From design systems and frontend infra to brand operations and creative workflows,  
> I build semantic clarity into complex systems — so they scale without breaking.

## The Problem I Solve:

When teams scale, **semantic drift sets in**.
- Components fork unnecessarily.
- Design patterns lose coherence.
- Product teams misalign across silos.
- Founders lose the thread of their own brand reasoning.

The problem isn’t tooling.  
It’s a **loss of structural clarity**.

I design systems that embed meaning into the work itself —  
so teams stay aligned, velocity increases, and design debt is reduced.

## Systems I’ve Built:

- **Savepoint Protocol** — Semantic traceability for product & design teams.
- **Validator Framework** — Pattern governance & UX consistency at scale.
- **Order of Aetherwright** — Operational clarity for creative systems.

These aren’t side projects.  
They’re **proof of how I think and build durable systems**.
